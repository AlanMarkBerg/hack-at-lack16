"ActivityType","Description"
"assessment","An assessment is an activity type that determines a learner’s mastery of a particular subject area. An assessment typically has one or more questions."
"attempt","An attempt is a discrete set of learner experiences in an activity. This activity gives systems the ability to uniquely identify experiences when they may have happened in different interactions with the same activity."
"course","A course represents an entire “content package” worth of material. The largest level of granularity. Unless flat, a course consists of multiple modules."
"file","A file is similar to a link, only the resource is more likely to be used at a) a different time, b) can be used offline, and/or c) could be used with a different system. Only the expectation changes. Files are not considered learning content or SCOs. If a file is intended for this purpose, it should be re-categorized."
"interaction","An interaction is typically a part of a larger activity (such as a assessment, game, or simulation) and refers to a control to which a learner provides input. An interaction can be either an asset or function independently."
"lesson","TA lesson is learning content that may or may not take on the form of a SCO (formal, tracked learning). A lesson may stand-alone or may be part of a larger course."
"link","A link is simply a means of expressing a link to another resource within, or external to, an activity. A link is not synonymous with launching another resource and should be considered external to the current resource. Links are not learning content, nor SCOs. If a link is intended for this purpose, it should be re-categorized."
"media","Media refers to text, audio, or video used to convey information. Media can be consumed (tracked: completed), but doesn’t have an interactive component that may result in a score, success, or failure."
"meeting","A meeting is a gathering of multiple people for a common cause or interest."
"module","TA module represents any “content aggregation” at least one level below the course level. Modules of modules can exist for layering purposes. Modules are not content. Modules are one level up from all content."
"objective","An objective determines whether competency has been achieved in a desired area. Objectives typically are associated with questions and assessments. Objectives are not learning content and cannot be SCOs."
"performance","A performance is an attempted task or series of tasks within a particular context. Tasks would likely take on the form of interactions, or the performance could be self-contained content. It emphasizes students or learners being able to do, or perform, specific skills as a result of the instruction."
"profile","A profile is an activity that defines a set of rules and recommendations for generating xAPI statements for a particular domain. The inclusion of a profile activity in a statement identifies that statement as following the rules outlined in the profile."
"question","A question is typically part of an assessment and requires a response from the learner, a response that is then evaluated for correctness."
"simulation","A simulation is an attempted task or series of tasks in an artificial context that mimics reality. Tasks would likely take on the form of interactions, or the simulation could be self-contained content."
